    "# Visualizing Geospatial Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## By Paco Nathan posted Sun May 17, 2020 11:25 PM\n",
    "## https://community.ibm.com/community/user/datascience/blogs/paco-nathan/2020/05/17/viz-geo-data-py     \n",
    " \n",
    "Throughout the global pandemic, many people have spent lots of time viewing maps that visualize data. Important data. People who work in data science are probably seeing increased needs to work with geospatial data, especially for visualizations. There are increased needs to understand metrics about geographic regions, to analyze supply chain, make plans that take into account local conditions and rules, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article shows how to use two popular geospatial libraries in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "**geopandas:** extends Pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types\n",
    "\n",
    "**geoplot:** a high-level geospatial plotting library\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second library is especially helpful since it builds on top of several other popular geospatial libraries, to simplify the coding that’s typically required. Those include: cartopy, which in turn leverages Cython, NumPy, GEOS, Shapely, pyshp, PROJ, Six, and perhaps a few others such as mapclassify, depending on which features you need to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: all of this code is available in a Jupyter notebook at https://github.com/DerwenAI/ibm_dsc_articles/blob/master/2020_05/tutorial.ipynb\n"

    "Terminology\n",
    "Part of the learning curve for working with geospatial data is that there’s lots of special terminology used. Here’s a handy cheat-sheet for terms that you’re likely to encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **shapefile:** data file format used to represent items on a map\n",
    "* **geometry:** a vector (generally a column in a dataframe) used to represent points, polygons, and other geometric shapes or locations, usually represented as well-known text (WKT)\n",
    "* **polygon:** an area\n",
    "* **point:** a specific location\n",
    "* **basemap:** the background setting for a map, such as county borders in California\n",
    "* **projection:** since the Earth is a 3D spheroid, chose a method for how an area gets flattened into 2D map, using some coordinate reference system (CRS)\n",
    "* **colormap:** choice of a color palette for rendering data, selected with the cmap parameter\n",
    "* **overplotting:** stacking several different plots on top of one another\n",
    "* **choropleth:** using different hues to color polygons, as a way to represent data levels\n",
    "* **kernel density estimation:** a data smoothing technique (KDE) that creates contours of shading to represent data levels\n",
    "* **cartogram:** warping the relative area of polygons to represent data levels\n",
    "* **quantiles:** binning data values into a specified number of equal-sized groups\n",
    "* **voronoi diagram:** dividing an area into polygons such that each polygon contains exactly one generating point and every point in a given polygon is closer to its generating point than to any other; also called a Dirichlet tessellation\n",
